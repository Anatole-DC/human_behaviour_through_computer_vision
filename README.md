<h1 align="center">HUMAN BEHAVIOUR THROUGH COMPUTER VISION</h1>

This is the repository concerning my research about the detection of human behaviour using computer vision. My approach is based on human skeleton.

The goal of this research is to determined whether a pose-based approach is a good solution to implement human behaviour detection. The assertion is that an machine learning algorithm will be more efficient with numeric data, instead of direct image recognition.

By detecting the human skeleton, the algorithm will be able to work with "bones" coordinates and orientation, which should increase the detection accuracy, and IA practice.
